## Introduction

Of late, I've noticed that there has been a huge plethora of web sites...which are devoted to using 'AI bot' technology.    
You just go there, 'sign up/register'...;   
or, sometimes, the technology is totally FREE to use when being combined with Internet Search Engines:   

- Apple Siri  
- Google Bard  
- Microsoft Bing  
- etc.  

You simply just visit that site; then, can ask the bot questions.../   
or, you can tell it what to do...such as generate this/or, generate that, including:    
text/programming language code/foreign language/pictures/-etc.  

One of my favourite sites to go and visit/use so far to date is: Character.Ai;    
it is a site that offers many different kinds of bot:  
- some with 'specific' uses: grammarly, image generator, -etc.  
- as well as, far more 'general' usage:  ChatGPT, AskMeAnything, -etc.
             
Basically, you can ask it just about anything,  
and ,the answers it returns back tends to be very interesting and useful, indeed;    
really well researched, and, so on.    

For example, things I might try asking are...  
- What is the meaning of Einstein's famous formula: E=McSq?   
- What is 'Quantum Mechanics'?   
- Can we have a conversation using beginner's French?
- Could you write me a poem using a foreign language? 
- etc.

-(**NOTE**: Some of these AI bots do only 'specific' tasks: generate/draw a pic;  
whilst other bots are a lot more 'general' in use, such as: search engine related.)-
