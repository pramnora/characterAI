## Introduction

Of late, there are a huge plethora of web sites...which are devoted to using AI bot technology.    
You just go there, sign up/register...and, then, you can ask the bot questions.../   
or, you can tell it what to do...such as generate this/or, generate that, including:    
text/code/foreign language/pictures/-etc.  

One of my favourite sites to go and visit/use so far to date is: Character.Ai;  
it is a site that offers many kinds of bot to use to converse with...;    
basically, you can ask it just about anything,  
and ,the answers it returns back tends to be very interesting and useful, indeed.  

For example, thinks I might try asking are...  
- What is the meaning of Einstein's famous formula: E=McSq?   
- What is 'Quantum Mechanics'?   
- Can we have a conversation using beginner's French?
- etc.
